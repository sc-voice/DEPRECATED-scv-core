### Website language
The website language preference changes the language shown for menus, labels, messages and settings. If you would like to add your own language, please [let us know](https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/wanted-translator-for-sc-voice-interface/13928).

### Translation
Suttas are available in the root language Pali and in multiple translation languages. Audio is bilingual by default, but you can set it to monolingual for brevity.

### Speaker
Each language has a designated speaking voice. Although most voices are automatically generated, Voice does offer some human audio recordings as well thanks to Bhante Sujato and many others.  Speakers differ in speaking rates. In addition, some speakers have lower pitch ranges to suit those with high-frequency hearing loss. 

### Bell sound
One may choose to mark the start and end of a playlist with a special sound such as a bell.

### Search results
By default, Voice returns only the top 5 search results. For those who desire more detail, this can be increased.
