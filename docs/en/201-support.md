## Support Policy

SuttaCentral Voice provides the following levels of support:

### Supported
Supported content is actively maintained by SuttaCentral, and any change that is made to the texts will be transferred to SuttaCentral Voice. Text supported by SuttaCentral is everything that is available in segmented form (see [Segmentation Technology](/sc-voice/en/201-segmentation)). On top of what is maintained by SuttaCentral, SuttaCentral Voice can still adapt phonetic errors for the different reading voices; this is however sometimes limited by the way the voices are programmed by the original provider.

* Supported texts will be displayed segment by segment in SuttaCentral Voice.
* If desired they can be matched with the respective Pali segments and read out line by line as a bilingual text (Settings > Languages > Show Pali and translation text).
* Supported texts are what SuttaCentral Voice search is scanning through when you enter a search request.

Please report any errors you may notice at [SuttaCentral discussion forum](https://discourse.suttacentral.net) under "Feedback". Errors can have multiple causes as well as remedies. For example, the [phonetic error](https://github.com/sc-voice/sc-voice/issues/1) of "one lives" vs. "two lives" is actually a bug with Amazon Polly Web Service, it is not a bug in SuttaCentral. Problems reported in the discussion forum will be triaged and assigned to relevant Github issues or dealt with immediately.

### Legacy
Legacy content comprises all texts on SuttaCentral that are not segmented. This distinction is not related to the quality of the translation, but simply reflects the technical status of the texts.

* Legacy texts will not be displayed segment by segment in SuttaCentral Voice.
* They can't be matched with the respective Pali segments and read out line by line as a bilingual text.
* Legacy texts are not scanned by SuttaCentral Voice search.

In case you notice any errors that might have been introduced in the process of adding these documents to SuttaCentral, please report them at [SuttaCentral discussion forum](https://discourse.suttacentral.net/) under "Feedback".
