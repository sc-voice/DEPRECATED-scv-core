## Sutta Player

<img src="/sc-voice/assets/img/sutta-player.png" width="100%"/>

The Sutta Player plays sutta text segments, 
speaking PƒÅli and translated text in alternation.
Click the bottom left play/pause button to start/stop audio playback.
Playback will continue section by section till the end of the sutta or playlist.

### Navigation

With playback paused, you can navigate to different text segments:

* Click the horizontal slider or select it with your screen reader to choose a different text segment within the current section. The left/right arrows proceed to the previous/next text segment. The SHIFT-left/SHIFT-right arrows move in larger increments.
* Click **Fast Backward** or **Fast Forward** to skip back/forward to the previous/next section.

### Customization
Click on _Settings_ to customize Sutta Player:

* Choose which language(s) to display and speak (e.g., Pali and translation text, only Pali text, only translation text).
* Choose which bell sound to play or none.

### Limitations
Playback requires an internet connection, since the audio for each spoken text segment is retrieved as needed. This "speak-on-demand" interaction lets you skip around a sutta quickly, sampling sound bites here and there. However, you'll need that internet connection.  For walking meditation, you may wish to consider [[Offline Listening]]
