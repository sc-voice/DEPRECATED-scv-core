### Acknowledgements
SuttaCentral Voice has been developed as a “younger sister” of [SuttaCentral](suttacentral.net). It was started in 2018 by Karl Lew who was soon joined by Aminah Borg-Luck. Some time later Anagarika Sabbamitta came as a third person to increase the team. In summer 2020, Robbie and Madhu joined us.

The Voice application uses content from the SuttaCentral website and produces it in voice output. We'd like to thank [all those who did and do contribute](https://suttacentral.net/acknowledgments) to this extraordinary collection of early Buddhist texts.

Voice uses [AWS Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/?nc2=type_a) voices with some customization. Especially customizing the Pali voice has been a challenge, and we are indebted to [many diligent voice reviewers](https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/sc-voice-raveena-meets-slow-amy/10410) for their help.

Voice uses Google Analytics for website usage statistics to guide features. We don't collect personal data.

Aminah researched Voice requirements for both assisted and non-assisted users and established clear accessibility guidelines for user interactions that would benefit all users. In addition, Aminah redesigned the Voice web page with an elegant, minimalist aesthetic that functions amazingly well for both assisted and non-assisted users. Intrepid as always, Aminah set up the Voice staging server on her own account, proving without a doubt that Voice can be replicated at will in the cloud.

After all these valuable contributions Aminah has retired from the team as of 2020, currently pursuing other interests, but graciously helping out Voice with occasional consult as the first Voice Emerita. We'd like to express our utmost gratitude!

Currently Voice is developed by a small core team and a number of other contributors.
